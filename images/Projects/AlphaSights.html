	<h1>Client Portal Redesign for AlphaSights</h1>
	<h3>6-week team-based project to update and increase usability of AlphaSights' client portal</h3>
	<div class=container overview>
		<h5>Overview</h5>
		<p>As part of Startup Institute, I worked in a group of 6 to consult for one of Startup Institute's partner companies. The scope of our project was to evaluate what AlphaSights had in place and to recommend improvements. In particular, our team focused on modernizing the usability and appearance of their pages, building an applet to simplify scheduling meetings and implementing a feature to enable downloads from a database into a presentable format.</p>

		<h5>My Role</5>
		<p>I was the UX designer and product manager for this project. As a UX designer, I identified the use case by means of conversation with AlphaSights, conducted user testing of AlphaSights' present system to identify pain points and develop clearer terminology. In addition, as a UX designer, I a) constructed a flow diagram of the business process of presenting experts to AlphaSights' customers, b) created wireframes for the redesign, and c) executed high-fidelity mockups to demonstrate our proposed ideas. I also explained the decision-making process behind our scheduling applet in the final presentation to AlphaSights. As product manager on a team this size, my function was to ensure the developers had the use case of the product at the core of their code, particularly in the scheduling tool.

		<h5>The Mockups</h5>
		<article><h4>Portal Design</h4><img src=""><p>The goal of the portal design was to create a centralized experience for AlphaSights' customers by increasing the utility of the page. Working from their style guide, I highlighted the most important aspect of the site--a client's projects, past and present. I added a view of historical projects into the same page as pending and active projects.</p></article>
		<article><h4>Proposal Page</h4><img src=""><p>I updated their old proposal page into a flat design consistent with AlphaSights' style guide, and added other features, such as a link to download multiple file formats, a scheduling calendar applet and a custom newsfeed for AlphaSights' clients.</p></article>
		<article><h4>Scheduling Tool</h4><img src=""><p>The scheduling tool is a challenge of both process and interface--it is time consuming to manually arrange conversations between very busy people. I was one of two in the group who developed the methodology we settled on, and communicated this to our developers so they could build a working tool. I also worked on the user interface, seeking a clear way to display 672 datapoints with four possible states--every hour in a week, that could be an acceptable time for either, both or neither side of the proposed conversation. For a demonstration of the working applet, contact Hao.</p></article>
